You know those videos on tiktok where theres a bouncing ball inside of another ball and when something happens i.e. it collides with the edge of the circle it's inside or if it falls out of the circle inside, something else happends, like more balls spawn or the ball gets faster or the ball gets bigger.... - Agent
